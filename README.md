### 👋 Hey there! I'm Sina - PhD Geek & AI Enthusiast

🌐 **Chillin' at University of Manitoba, Canada - Digging Deep into Geophysics**

🎓 What's up? I'm currently rocking my PhD in Geophysics at the University of Manitoba. I've got a thing for the secrets beneath our feet, and I'm all about using receiver functions to decode the Earth's mysterious structures. It's like being a detective, but for the planet!

💡 **AI + Earth = Future Unlocked**

🤖 Imagine combining the raw power of Mother Nature with the slick braininess of AI - that's my playground. I'm weaving AI into my geophysics projects, making the Earth's data dance in ways you've never seen. It's not just research; it's a revolution.

🚀 **More than Just a Nerd**

🎧 When I'm not busy being a PhD wizard, you might find me jamming to some tunes, dabbling in the latest tech, or daydreaming about the next big breakthrough. I believe in mixing a bit of fun with function, and a whole lot of cool with science.
